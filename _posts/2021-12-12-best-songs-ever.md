As a music fan, selecting simply the top 10 songs of all time is quite difficult. But I'll try my best to provide you with some of my own favorites.

If you don't want to waste time reading my thoughts on these songs, you can go straight to this Spotify playlist and listen to themüòä

1. **"Stairway to Heaven" - Led Zeppelin**

    "Stairway to Heaven" is often regarded as the best Led Zeppelin song of all time, and it may well be the greatest rock song ever composed. The "Stairway" guitar solo is considered the finest of all time by Guitar World.

    The vagueness of the lyrics also allows listeners to interpret the song in their own way, adding to the magic and mystery of the track.


2. **"November Rain" - Guns N‚Äô Roses**
    
    "November Rain" is an almost 9-minute song that combines Rose's yearning vocals and heartbreaking piano.
    The "November Rain" video is one of the most expensive music promotions ever filmed, with a budget of about $1 million.
    This is, without a doubt, the greatest rock ballad ever written.


3. **"In my life" - The Beatles (cover by Himesh Patel)**

    The true magic lies in the lyrics of the song. "In My Life" was Lennon's "first major great piece of writing" since it was the first time he wrote intimate lyrics about his own life, according to him.

    This has been covered by Himesh Patel in the movie Yesterday, and just nailed it.


4. **"My Way" - Frank Sinatra**
    
    "My Way," one of Sinatra's most well-known songs, is acclaimed as an all-time classic. It retains the record for the longest duration in the UK top 40 singles chart, at 75 weeks.
    
    The song was a success for a variety of performers including Sinatra, Jocelyne,¬†[Elvis Presley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley), and¬†[Sid Vicious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Vicious).

    
5.  **"Smells Like Teen Spirit" - Nirvana**

    Nirvana's song Smells Like Teen Spirit is the band's most well-known song.

    Kurt came up with the title after one of his friends, Kathleen Hanna, spray-painted "Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit" on the wall of his flat. Teen Spirit is a female deodorant; Kurt may have used it, or she or someone else may have applied it to him, causing him to "Smell Like Teen Spirit."


6. **"Wind of Change" - Scorpions**
    
    "Wind of Change" was released as the album's third single in January 1991 and became a worldwide hit, just after the failed coup that would eventually lead to the end of the Soviet Union.
    
    In an interview, Klaus Meine stated that the attitude in the Soviet Union during the years 1988-1989 was defined by the feeling that the Cold War was coming to an end, and that music was the unifying factor between the peoples.


7. **"The Scientist" - Coldplay** 
    
    Coldplay has created numerous masterpieces, but we only have a top ten list. I can only choose one of their songs.
    It's fascinating that Chris Martin, the song's writer, named it "*The Scientist***"**. He continues to perform these experiments in his relationship, and they always end in the same way: the break¬†up.


8. **"The Man Who Sold the World" - David Bowie (covered by Nirvana)** 
    
    When it was first released in 1970, "The Man Who Sold the World" received relatively little attention.
    This song was performed by Nirvana, an American rock band, in 1993, and their performance on the television show MTV Unplugged brought it to a new audience.


9. **‚ÄúLosing My Religion‚Äù - R.E.M.**
    
    Thirty years ago, R.E.M. released¬†*Out of Time*, and went on to become R.E.M.'s highest-charting single in the United States, reaching No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and extending the band's influence beyond its core fan base.


10. **‚ÄúHotel California‚Äù - The Eagles**
    
    The song's lyrics have been interpreted in a variety of ways by fans and critics alike, with the Eagles defining it as their "version of the high life in Los Angeles."
    
    *Hotel California*¬†drew heroic sales figures and critical plaudits in equal measure. The song was awarded the¬†[Grammy Award for Record of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Record_of_the_Year)¬†in¬†[1978](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Annual_Grammy_Awards).
