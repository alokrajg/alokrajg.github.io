I'm currently working as a **Data Science Engineer** at AVL, since March 2019.

Trying to solve complex real-world problems by utilizing quantitative analytics and interpretable machine learning models.

*I've always been eager to take on new technical challenges that will allow me to acquire new skills and fulfill my curiosity. As an Data ScienceÂ Engineer, I enjoy putting my technical and analytical skills to use, solving new problems, and learning new things every day.*
